# ReactBoilerplate
This is a simple React, Webpack, and Bable boilerplate. Feel free to use to to jumpstart your next project.

## How to use
First make sure that you have NodeJS installed. Then clone this repo and install it.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/anazari/ReactBoilerplate.git <yourProjectName>
$ cd <yourProjectName>
